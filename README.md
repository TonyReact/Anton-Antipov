## Reflection

The project was completed in accordance with the terms of reference.
The task was to write a UI application to read only skv files and process the data inside the file.

According to the assignment, I have to display on the screen only those values ​​that match in the 3rd column for #1 and #2 and count the number of days for prooject #3 participants under the numbers #1 and #2 worked together on the project.

The difficulty was that I could not display all the values as array elements. Unfortunately, I had to manually remove some characters from the string type.

UI design was developed by me. There was no execution pattern or requirements, so I was able to implement my design idea.
There was no point in making an extension for the mobile version, but I still wanted to do it for the iPhone 13 pro.
